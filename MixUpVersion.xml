Hello, everyone!
We highly recommend that you upgrade to this version, as it fixes a lot of issues that were causing high CPU, GPU and memory load. 
This could lead to high PC heating and eventually to lower Surface performance.
Also many bugs were fixed which could lead to program hangs and crashes.

Changelog:
- Canon camera: fixed crash if no photo downloaded
- Canon camera: fixed high latency before photo capture
- Fixed: Camera don't have enough time to start if only one project used (no options for users to select)
- Now camera starts only before capture in booth mode
- Fixed: high CPU load after chromakey capture
- Fixed: Memory leaks on chromakey render
- Optimized chromakey render on 720p resolution
- Optimized memory usage while app running
- Optimized CPU & GPU usage
- Fixed overwriting video on chromakey render
- Fixed QR code sharing hotspot initialization on app startup
- Fixed crash on player load
