Release 1.7.0.2 Changelog:
   
Hi, we've made a major new update to the MixUp app.
We've added a new kind of processing - LittlePlanet, now you can create real 360 flyover videos with 360 cameras. 
Use GoPro Max or Garmin Virb360 cameras to do this.

Mass actions for the administrator have been added to the gallery. Admin can send multiple files to mail, print, hide or delete them. 
Guests can now hide their photo or video from the gallery.

We have added support for Gopro Hero Black (6,7,8) cameras.

Video processing speed has been significantly accelerated, even on heavy video templates.
The video editor has been improved. Now previews are created faster, and interaction with the interface has become more convenient.
You no longer need to specify the frame rate in video templates. 

Important! Be sure to recheck your video templates that were set to settings other than FPS:30 after installing the update. 
The setting of cuts relative to the original timeline may have shifted.

We have also added the ability to set the frame from which the preview is made for the gallery.

And also a lot of fixes, improvements and optimizations have been made.
