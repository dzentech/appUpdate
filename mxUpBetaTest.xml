Release 1.6.1.4 Changelog:
   
Hi! We've made a small but very useful update to the MixUp App.

Improvements:
   The quality of final photos has been significantly improved. 
   First of all we have increased the resolution for photo templates to 600dpi! 
   Images on prints became sharper and clearer.
   Also we added compression quality settings for your final photos. 
   You can find this setting in the Render Settings window

Fixed:
   -Fixed saving customization (background and overlay) for photo templates.
   -Fixed a couple of small bugs with on-screen keyboard.
   -Fixed mail sending statuses
