Release 1.8.5.0 Changelog:
   
Hi, it's Ai Wizard time!

We've been working on this update for a long time and we finally present you our Ai Wizard for photo processing. 
We tried to push the maximum AI capabilities for your events.
Now there are 3 options to work with AI - Deepfake, Ai Chromakey and Ai Painter. 
Our favorite is Ai Painter in Imagine mode. AI will create stunning images based on your photos. 
Trust us, your clients will love it.

Random template selection:
In addition to adding this great AI feature, we have decided to add such a feature as random selection of project and templates. 
This functionality can make a new experience of using your photo booth at an event. 
Guests won't know what will be on the final content until the end.

Photo review screen:
With this function, you can review the photo immediately after taking it and give the option to take it again.

We have also made a number of improvements and fixes in the software. 
- We made convenient scrolling with the touch screen.
- Made more convenient color selection in the backlight menu.
- We fixed the work with web cameras.
- Made a better preview loading window for your awesome projects.

And also a lot of fixes, improvements and optimizations have been made.
